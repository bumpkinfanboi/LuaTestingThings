Updated README, 12/9/2025

I am making a tiny shitty little rouge clone just to get the basics of lua down, so don't expect the moon.
I work on this when I want, It's been about a month and I have >200 lines of code.
This is eventually going to be backported to Roblox Studio to be used in another project I'm working on (I barely started that, need to do this first)

How to run: don't

How to actually run: Runs in the terminal, you need to install lua 5.4 for it.

Step by step for
Linux:

  sudo apt install lua5.4 (or use any other package manager you want)
  
  lua [insert filename here].lua 
  
Windows: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16691082/how-to-install-lua-on-windows
  
  (I just use WSL, lol)


TODO LIST:
Finish reworking mapgen

Add multiple rooms and going back and forth between them

Add hallways (and roomtypes ..?)

Add enemies

Add staircases to new floors

Add items

Implement hunger/thirst and the player health system

Add a quit command

Add a constant query so you don't have to rerun the program (oops!)

+ a lot more
