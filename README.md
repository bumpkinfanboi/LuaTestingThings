Updated README, 12/11/2025

I am making a tiny shitty little rouge clone just to get the basics of lua down, so don't expect the moon.
I work on this when I want, It's been about a month and I have >200 lines of code.
This is eventually going to be backported to Roblox Studio to be used in another project I'm working on (I barely started that, need to do this first)

This program runs in ANY TERMINAL, as long as you have lua installed.

In order to run this program, you need to download the code from the github repository and unzip the file. You need to run the file called NewMapGen.lua

In order to install lua and run the program in linux, you need to run:

sudo apt install lua5.4

lua PATH/TO/FILE/NewMapGen.lua

In order to install this program on Windows 11, you need to run:

winget "lua for windows"

lua PATH/TO/FILE/NewMapGet.lua


The program has a "help" command, so by typing help you can see what commands are available.


TODO LIST:

Add multiple rooms and going back and forth between them

Add hallways (and roomtypes ..?)

Add enemies

Add staircases to new floors

Add player movement

Fix bugs

Make the program less obtuse and able to be configured without a text editor 

+ a lot more
